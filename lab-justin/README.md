#Chatroom!

This is a project that creates a chatroom using node.js net module.

in index.js I use a Constructor to allow for the usage of data that allows me to do various tings for the user such as keep track we they connect/disconnect, give them a username as well as implement '/' commands that give the user some interaction such as allowing them to choose their username, send direct messages to other users, troll the chat, and quit the chat(the default way is confusing)

to enter the chatroom, run index.js in node, then in a new tab or window in terminal type in telnet localhost 3000, then you're all set!
